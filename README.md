Latlisc here, I'm an idiot trying to teach themself python.

I really don't know what I'm doing, please don't expect me to be able to help.

I actually usually do digital art but who doesn't like learning new things?

If you need to talk to me for some reason, you can try the following platforms:

Email: latiaswwq@gmail.com

Discord: Latlisc#9501

Newgrounds: latlisc.newgrounds.com

I don't really know why you would bother with hunting me down on Newgrounds,

but my social media prescence is almost nonexistant and it does have private messaging.

I actually got a GitHub account so I could make custom player models in a minecraft mod,

in case you were wondering just how "cool" I can be lmao.

My current plans involve programing a discord bot to do things for my private server,

mainly scheduled messages, chemistry math, and maybe image creation/manipulation;

but those are all probably about as good as pipe dreams at the moment,

I have a   l o t   to learn.
